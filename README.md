# Renaissance

This platform is designed to manage initiatives and projects across the entire organization, providing end-to-end visibility and governance. Initiatives are captured in a centralized funnel and guided through structured approval stages—known as Gate Reviews—from G0 (Identified) to G5 (Completed).

Each initiative begins with a project charter and is submitted by the designated initiative owner. It then progresses through clearly defined approval gates, with the appropriate stakeholders from the relevant workstream responsible for each stage of validation and sign-off.

Serving as a single source of truth, this system ensures alignment, accountability, and traceability throughout the project lifecycle. This approach similarly emphasizes standardized processes, digital governance, and enterprise-wide project portfolio management. However, it provides added value by offering a fully tailored solution that reflects the unique approval workflows, gate criteria, and reporting needs of the organization—without reliance on external templates or generic modules.
