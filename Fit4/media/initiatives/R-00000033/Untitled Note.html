<p>For SPDC material procurement, current practice with vendors is for Shell to put aside a VAT of 7.5% to pay the government statutory requirement. However, the 7.5% VAT is currently calculated based on the gross PO value which is not aligned with legislation. This tax should however be levied only on the mark up component of all material transactions and not the entire PO value. So, this initiative helps us to charge the VAT on the mark-up only and so make some savings.</p><p><br></p><p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">2021 target is set at the level of actual savings for 2020 which is </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;">US$1,150,555.00 with</span><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> FCF Target of US$ 300,294.86.
